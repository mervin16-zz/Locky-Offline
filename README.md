## Introduction
This is the official Github Repo of [Locky](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.th3pl4gu3.locky_offline), an offline Material Design Password Manager.

Locky is an easy to use password manager that is designed with minimalist components and adheres to the material design. 
It's time to stop writing passwords on papers or use short unsafe passwords just for the sake of remembering it. 
You can save any passwords and bank cards offline on your own phone.
With the Locky app you get:
• An organized password list - Add a password anytime and sort them accordingly as provided in Locky. To make things more elegant, you can also search for an icon to assign to your password.
• An organized bank card list - Add your bank card details anytime and sort them accordingly as provided in Locky. The application will automatically determine the card type and assign a beautiful logo to it.
• An organized devices list - Add your personal devices (such as home routers, personal computers, IOT devices etc...) and you never have to remember your password again.
• Offline storing - All your data is stored offline on your own device. No one can access it. You can create multiple accounts if you want to separate some data.
• Auto Backup to your Google Drive - Your data is backup everyday on your personal google account configured on your phone.
